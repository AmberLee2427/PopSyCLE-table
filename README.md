# PopSyCLE Table Manipulation

This repository contains scripts to process raw simulation outputs from the Population Synthesis for Compact object Lensing Events (PopSyCLE) pipeline into a user-friendly, analysis-ready catalog of binary-source microlensing events.

## Features

- Load and process FITS files using Astropy and Pandas
- Filter and manipulate large astronomical datasets
- Calculate derived physical quantities (e.g., distances, angular separations)
- Export results to CSV for further analysis

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
project/
├── data/                # Directory for input and output data (should be in .gitignore)
│   ├── all_fields_Mrun_EWS_w_comp_params.fits  (Input)
│   ├── t_comp_rb_no_cuts_all_fields.fits       (Unused)
│   ├── t_lightcurves_no_cuts_all_fields.fits   (Unused)
│   ├── column_names.txt                        (Outout) # Column names for the all_fields_Mrun_EWS_w_comp_params.fits table
│   └── popsycle_table_with_calc.csv            (Output)
├── make_database.ipynb  # Jupyter Notebook to process data
├── environment.yml      # Conda environment definition
└── README.md            # This file

```

## Requirements

The primary dependencies are Python 3.11 and the packages listed in the environment file.

- [Astropy](https://www.astropy.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

You can install the complete environment using Conda:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate popsycle
````

## Workflow

1.  **Setup:** Clone this repository and activate the Conda environment as described above.

2.  **Data Placement:** Download the necessary PopSyCLE data (`all_fields_Mrun_EWS_w_comp_params.fits`) and place it inside the `data/` directory.

3.  **Execution:** Open and run the `make_database.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook from top to bottom. This will perform all filtering and calculations.

4.  **Output:** The notebook will generate `popsycle_table_with_calc.csv` in the `data/` directory. This file contains the final, clean catalog of binary-source events.

## Using the Output Data

The final output table contains the following key columns with their corresponding units:

| Column Name | Units | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `M_L` | Solar Masses ($M_\odot$) | Mass of the primary lens star. |
| `D_L_kpc` | Kiloparsecs (kpc) | Distance to the lens. |
| `D_S_kpc` | Kiloparsecs (kpc) | Distance to the source. |
| `mu_rel_mas_yr`| Milliarcseconds/year | Relative lens-source proper motion. |
| `theta_E_mas` | Milliarcseconds (mas) | Einstein radius of the lensing event. |
| `binary_sep_arcsec`| Arcseconds (") | Projected angular separation of the source binary. |
| `gal_lon_S_deg`| Degrees | Galactic longitude of the source. |
| `gal_lat_S_deg`| Degrees | Galactic latitude of the source. |

You can easily load and begin working with this table using Pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the analysis-ready catalog
df = pd.read_csv('data/popsycle_table_with_calc.csv')

# Display the first few events
print(df.head())
```
